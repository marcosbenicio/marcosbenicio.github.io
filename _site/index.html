      <span><strong>30 Apr 2024</strong> - Decision Tree and Random Forest</span>
       
        <p> A decision tree is a recursive model that employs partition-based methods to predict the class for each instance. The process starts by splitting the dataset into two partitions based on metrics like information gain for classification or variance reduction for regression. These partitions are further divided recursively, until a state is achieved in which most instances within a partition belong to the same class (for classification) or have similar values (for regression).
Decision trees also can be extended into ensemble models such as random forests, which combine multiple trees to improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2024/01/22/taxi-trip-regression.html">Analysis of Taxi Trip Duration in NYC</a></h3>
      <span><strong>22 Jan 2024</strong> - Regression, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and K-means clustering</span>
       
        <p> In this project, we will build a machine learning model to predict the trip duration of taxi rides in New York City. The dataset is from Kaggle. The original dataset have approximately 1.4 million entries for the training set and 630k for the test set, although only the training set is used in this project. The dataset is then preprocessed, outliers are removed, and new features are created, followed by splitting it into train, test, and validation sets.
The goal is to predict the trip duration of taxi trips in New York City. The evaluation metric used for this project is the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE). The RMSLE is calculated by taking the log of the predictions and actual values. This metric ensures that errors in predicting short trip durations are less penalized compared to errors in predicting longer ones. For this purpose, we employ three types of machine learning models: mini-batch k-means to create new cluster features for the locations, and the Decision Tree Regressor and XGBoost to predict the trip duration. </p>

        <p> Diabetes is among the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States, impacting millions of Americans each year. Diabetes is a chronic disease in which individuals lose the ability to effectively regulate levels of glucose in the blood, and can lead to reduced quality of life and life expectancy.
This project uses the Diabetes Health Indicators dataset, available on kaggle. The project seeks answer the following questions: Which risk factors most strongly predict diabetes? Can a subset of the risk factors to accurately predict whether an individual has diabetes? </p>

      <h3><a href="/2023/11/27/cnn.html">Understanding Convolutional Layers in a Convolutional Neural Network</a></h3>
      <span><strong>27 Nov 2023</strong> - Convolutional Neural Network and Classification</span>
       
        <p> A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is essentially a feedforward Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that is designed to recognize local patterns and sparsity (not all connections between neurons are active or significant) in input data. Like the MLP, each neuron is connected to others through learnable weights. These weights are adjusted during training to optimize the network's performance for a specific task.
The main difference between MLPs and CNNs is that the latter is developed for processing multidimensional data, such as images or videos. Also, CNNs have a more diverse set of specialized layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and upsampling layers, which are optimized for processing spatial (image) and temporal data (video). In this article, we will focus on the convolutional layer and the max pooling layers, which are the core of CNNs. </p>

            <p> A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is essentially a feedforward Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that is designed to recognize local patterns and sparsity (not all connections between neurons are active or significant) in input data. Like the MLP, each neuron is connected to others through learnable weights. These weights are adjusted during training to optimize the network's performance for a specific task.
The main difference between MLPs and CNNs is that the latter is developed for processing multidimensional data, such as images or videos. Also, CNNs have a more diverse set of specialized layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and upsampling layers, which are optimized for processing spatial (image) and temporal data (video). In this article, we will focus on the convolutional layer and the max pooling layers, which are the core of CNNs. </p>

            <p> A decision tree is a recursive model that employs partition-based methods to predict the class for each instance. The process starts by splitting the dataset into two partitions based on metrics like information gain for classification or variance reduction for regression. These partitions are further divided recursively, until a state is achieved in which most instances within a partition belong to the same class (for classification) or have similar values (for regression).
Decision trees also can be extended into ensemble models such as random forests, which combine multiple trees to improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting. </p>

            <p> In this project, we will build a machine learning model to predict the trip duration of taxi rides in New York City. The dataset is from Kaggle. The original dataset have approximately 1.4 million entries for the training set and 630k for the test set, although only the training set is used in this project. The dataset is then preprocessed, outliers are removed, and new features are created, followed by splitting it into train, test, and validation sets.
The goal is to predict the trip duration of taxi trips in New York City. The evaluation metric used for this project is the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE). The RMSLE is calculated by taking the log of the predictions and actual values. This metric ensures that errors in predicting short trip durations are less penalized compared to errors in predicting longer ones. For this purpose, we employ three types of machine learning models: mini-batch k-means to create new cluster features for the locations, and the Decision Tree Regressor and XGBoost to predict the trip duration. </p>
